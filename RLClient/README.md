Java, Leapmotion and a Raspberry Pi with some LEDs :)

See it in action here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRHMy_JaD0A

Currently only the x64 LeapMotion dlls are included and copied to the working directory on start. For some reason for me this only works in the IDE at the moment, and not from the command line... I have to spent some time for investigation later.
